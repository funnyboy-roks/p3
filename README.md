# p<sup>3</sup> -- Python PreProcessor

A work-in-progress preprocessor for Python that makes it a slightly more
tolerable language to work with.

## Currently supported

- `&&` -> `and`
- `||` -> `or`
- `true` -> `True`
- `false` -> `False`

## Want to support in the future

- `{` and `}` to make blocks that go to the appropriate indent.
- Other stuff? Idk, open to ideas!
